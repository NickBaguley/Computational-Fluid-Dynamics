# Diffusion Equation

In this project a first-order forward-time and second-order central space (FTCS) scheme is used to discretize the governing partial differential equation (PDE).  The governing PDE is a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes Equation, and is of the form of a TK PDE.  The PDE is solved for a flow between two parallel plates extended to infinity.  

To verify the accuracy of the numerical scheme developed, a mesh refinement study is conducted in order to obtain the grid independent solution.  Both the truncation error and stability conditions for the FTCS scheme are investigated.  In order to validate the solution, the results obtained from the numerical scheme are compared to those obtained from the analytical solution.
